# GitHub Deployment Guide for Enchanted Letters

This guide will walk you through deploying your Enchanted Letters website to GitHub Pages, making it accessible to the world with a free GitHub URL.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one)
- Git installed on your computer
- The Enchanted Letters website files (which we've prepared for you)

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account

2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the green "New" button or the "+" icon in the top right
   - Choose "New repository"

3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `flowerletters` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Enchanted Letters - Stories Delivered by Mail"
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Public" (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Follow these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/flowerletters

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flowerletters.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the "Settings" tab (near the top right of the repository page)

2. **Find Pages Section**:
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar and click "Pages"

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Choose "main"
   - **Folder**: Select "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - GitHub will show a message that your site is being deployed
   - This usually takes 1-5 minutes

## Step 4: Access Your Live Website

Once deployment is complete, your website will be available at:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/flowerletters
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

## Step 5: Update Your Website

To make changes to your website:

1. **Edit your files locally**
2. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Wait 1-5 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Repository not found" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you've replaced `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

**Issue**: Website shows 404 error
- **Solution**: 
  - Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
  - Ensure your main file is named `index.html`
  - Wait a few more minutes for deployment to complete

**Issue**: Changes not appearing on live site
- **Solution**:
  - Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
  - Wait up to 10 minutes for GitHub's CDN to update
  - Check that your changes were successfully pushed to GitHub

**Issue**: CSS or JavaScript not loading
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure all file paths are relative (no leading slashes)
  - Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use your own domain name:

1. **Buy a domain** from a registrar like Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
2. **Add CNAME file** to your repository root with your domain name
3. **Configure DNS** at your registrar to point to GitHub Pages
4. **Update GitHub Pages settings** to use your custom domain

## Security and Best Practices

- **Never commit sensitive information** like API keys or passwords
- **Use HTTPS**: GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates
- **Regular updates**: Keep your website content fresh and up-to-date
- **Monitor performance**: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights

## Next Steps

After deployment, consider:

1. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags, sitemap, and Google Analytics
2. **Performance**: Optimize images and minimize CSS/JavaScript
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure your site works for all users
4. **Social Media**: Add Open Graph tags for better social sharing

- **GitHub Community**: [github.community](https://github.community)
- **Stack Overflow**: Search for "GitHub Pages" related questions
